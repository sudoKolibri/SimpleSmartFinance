### 1. **Summary in the Reports Section** (Main Report View)

The **Reports** section is naturally suited for presenting summary information, especially when focusing on overall finances. Here's how this would work:

- **Purpose**: To provide a big-picture overview of the user's financial situation over a specific time frame.
- **Contents**:
    - Total balances across all accounts.
    - Category spending breakdowns (e.g., total spent on groceries, entertainment, etc.).
    - Budgets and how much has been used/spent in each category.
    - Graphs/charts showing trends over time (monthly, weekly, etc.).

This works well when the user is interested in understanding their overall financial health rather than just focusing on specific accounts.

### 2. **Summary in the AccountView** (Split-Screen Style)

In the **AccountView**, you can add a **vertical split-screen** layout where the user can see both:

- **Account List**: The left side would display all the user's individual accounts (checking, savings, etc.).
- **Summary Panel**: The right side would show a **summary** of the overall balance, including a quick breakdown of balances across accounts, recent transactions, or key financial insights.

#### Benefits of Including a Summary in the AccountView:

- **At-a-Glance Information**: The user can quickly see both the details of individual accounts and a holistic view of their financial status in one place.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: If the user selects a specific account, the summary could update to include that account's contributions to the total balance or even give a mini-report just for that account.

#### Example Layout for AccountView (Vertical Split-Screen):

---------------------------------------------------
| Accounts List            | Summary View         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| - Checking Account        | Total Balance: $X   |
| - Savings Account         | Spent This Month: $Y|
| - Credit Card Account     | Upcoming Bills: $Z  |
---------------------------------------------------

#### Contents of the **Summary**:

- **Total Balance Across All Accounts**: Show the combined balance of all accounts.
- **Recent Transactions**: A list of the most recent transactions across all accounts.
- **Spending Overview**: How much has been spent this month, broken down by category or account.

### How These Two Views Complement Each Other:

- **AccountView Summary**: Provides quick, actionable insights alongside specific account details, perfect for a day-to-day overview.
- **Reports Section**: Offers a deeper dive into spending habits, trends over time, and budget trackingâ€”ideal for reviewing financial health and planning.

### Recommendation:

- **Include the summary in both places**:
    - **AccountView** for immediate, quick-access summaries while viewing specific accounts.
    - **Reports Section** for more detailed and customizable reports with graphs and breakdowns by category, budget, or time.
